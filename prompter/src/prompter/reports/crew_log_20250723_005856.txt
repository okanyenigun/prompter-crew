IMPORTANT: Focus on PROMPT ENGINEERING terminology, not general domain keywords. Think about how prompt engineers categorize and tag prompts in repositories.
Your task is to identify prompt engineering concepts such as: 1. **Prompt Techniques**: few-shot, zero-shot, chain-of-thought, step-by-step, reasoning, classification, generation, extraction, summarization, analysis, creative, instruction-following 2. **Output Formats**: structured, json, xml, list, bullet-points, numbered, format-specified 3. **Prompt Patterns**: template, examples, persona, role-play, system-prompt, user-prompt, context-aware 4. **AI Task Types**: text-generation, content-creation, brainstorming, naming, creative-writing, copywriting, marketing 5. **Prompt Engineering Methods**: iterative, refined, optimized, enhanced, systematic
For the improved prompt from the previous task, identify: - What prompt engineering technique is being used? (e.g., instruction-following, creative-generation) - What type of AI task is this? (e.g., creative-writing, naming, content-creation) - What prompt patterns are applied? (e.g., structured-output, example-driven, context-specific) - What format or style is specified? (e.g., creative, professional, casual)
Generate 3-5 keywords that prompt engineers would use to categorize this type of prompt in a repository. Think narrow and specific to prompt engineering, not broad domain terms.
Examples of good prompt engineering keywords: "few-shot", "creative-generation", "structured-prompt", "instruction-following", "content-creation", "naming-task", "brainstorming", "systematic-prompt" Examples of bad general keywords: "business", "technology", "apps", "productivity", "marketing"
Focus on generating search terms that would find prompts with similar PROMPT ENGINEERING structures and techniques.

### Structured Prompts
1. You are an AI tasked with evaluating groups of related news articles, called clusters, for inclusion in an AI-focused newsletter. Each cluster represents a distinct news event, development, or trend in the field of AI, summarized with a title and a brief description capturing the essence of the grouped articles. Your goal is to determine whether a given cluster should be included based on specific criteria.
   - Here is the information for the cluster you need to evaluate:
   - <cluster_title>
   - {cluster_title}
   - </cluster_title>
   - <cluster_summary>
   - {cluster_summary}
   - </cluster_summary>
   - Evaluate this cluster based on the following criteria:
     1. Relevance: Is the event directly related to AI technology, its applications, usage or implications?
     2. Novelty: Does the event represent a new development, breakthrough, or significant change in the AI landscape? Does it bring something new to the table, not just reiterate known information?
     3. Impact: Does the event have potential consequences for the AI industry, businesses, or society at large? Does it matter beyond just the immediate context?
     4. Specificity: Is it about a concrete happening, not just a general trend or statistic? Is the event well-defined and clearly articulated?
   - Analyze the cluster carefully, considering how well it meets each of these criteria. Think through your reasoning for each criterion.
   - After your analysis, provide a justification for your decision. Explain how the cluster meets or fails to meet each criterion, giving specific examples from the cluster title and summary to support your reasoning.
   - Finally, based on your analysis and justification, make a decision on whether to include or exclude this cluster from the newsletter.
   - If your decision is to exclude the cluster, use the most appropriate exclusion reason such as:
     - "not-relevant", "not-specific", or "other", with an appropriate explanation.

### Instruction-Following
1. Introduction: This prompt is designed to evaluate the necessity of a follow-up to a recent customer chat.
   - Context: [Include a summary of the customer issue, the tone of the conversation, any specific requests made by the customer, and the resolution provided if any.]
   - Considerations: Assess customer satisfaction, issue resolution completeness, potential for further questions or clarification, and the customer's expressed need for follow-up.
   - Attached/Referenced: {Chat history or conversation}
   - Evaluation Criteria: Determine the need for a follow-up based on unresolved issues, customer dissatisfaction, unclear resolution, or open-ended questions in the chat.
   - Required Action: Provide a clear recommendation on whether a follow-up is necessary, and if so, suggest the key points to address.
   - Only respond with a "Y" if needs to a follow-up with the customer or with an "N" if is not necessary.
